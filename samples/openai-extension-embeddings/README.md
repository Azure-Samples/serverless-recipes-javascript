This sample demonstrates how to use Azure OpenAI embeddings with [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript) the [Azure OpenAI extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-openai?tabs=isolated-process&pivots=programming-language-typescript).

## Overview

![Application architecture](./docs/images/architecture.drawio.png)

This application is made from multiple components:

- A serverless API built with [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript) using [Azure Functions bindings for OpenAI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-openai-extension).

- Hosted AI models with [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview).

## Run the sample

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Azure account. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) to get free Azure credits to get started. If you're a student, you can also get free credits with [Azure for Students](https://aka.ms/azureforstudents).
- Azure account permissions:
  - Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](docs/deploy_existing.md#resource-group).
  - Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

### Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/46c627e39bbc46bb902793d3d16105b1) for the resources below to get an estimate.

- Azure Functions: Flex Consumption plan, Free for the first 250K executions. Pricing per execution and memory used. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, embedding model. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with LRS. Pricing per GB stored and data transfer. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down --purge`.

### Setup development environment

You can run this project directly in your browser by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code.

1. [**Fork**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-recipes-javascript/fork) the project to create your own copy of this repository.
2. On your forked repository, select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, and clink on the button **Create codespace on main**.
   ![Screenshot showing how to create a new codespace](../../docs/images/codespaces.png?raw=true)
3. Wait for the Codespace to be created, it should take a few minutes.

If you prefer to run the project locally, follow [these instructions](../../README.md#use-your-local-environment).

### Deploy Azure resources

Open a terminal in the project root and follow these steps to deploy the Azure resources needed:

```bash
# Open the sample directory
cd samples/openai-extension-embeddings

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Deploy the sample to Azure
azd auth login
azd up
```

You will be prompted to select a base location for the resources. If you're unsure of which location to choose, select `eastus2`.
The deployment process will take a few minutes.

### Test the application

Once the resources are deployed, you can run the following command to run the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the Azure Functions application locally. You can test the application by sending a POST request to the `/embeddings/text` endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7071/api/embeddings/text -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Hello, world!"}'
```

You should receive a response with an object containing the embeddings for the text, as a series of numbers.
Alternatively, you can also open the file `api.http` and click on **Send Request** to test the endpoints.

### Clean up

To clean up all the Azure resources created by this sample:

1. Run `azd down --purge`
2. When asked if you are sure you want to continue, enter `y`

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted.

## Key concepts

Generating embeddings is the process of transforming text into a vector representation that captures the meaning of the text. The processing of text data typically involves chunking the text into smaller pieces, such as sentences or paragraphs, and then making an OpenAI call to produce embeddings for each chunk independently. Finally, the resulting embeddings are usually stored in a database or other data store for later use, but here we are returning them directly to the client.

Open the `src/functions` folder to see the code for the Azure Functions. Our API is composed of three endpoints:

- `POST /embeddings/text`: This endpoint take a JSON object with a `text` property and returns the embeddings for the text, using the OpenAI embeddings input binding with the `RawText` input type.

- `POST /embeddings/file`: This endpoint takes a JSON object with a `filePath` property and chunk the text content located at the specified file path on the local file system using `maxChunkLength` characters per chunk, and returns the embeddings for each chunk, using the OpenAI embeddings input binding with the `FilePath` input type.

- `POST /embeddings/url`: This endpoint works similarly to the file endpoint, but takes a `url` property instead of a file path. It returns the embeddings for each chunk of text content located at the specified URL, using the OpenAI embeddings input binding with the `Url` input type.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any issue when running or deploying this sample, please check the [troubleshooting guide](../../docs/troubleshooting.md). If you can't find a solution to your problem, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-recipes-javascript/issues).
